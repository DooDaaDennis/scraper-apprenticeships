The dispensation will last from 31/08/24 to 30/09/26 but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.&nbsp;\nEnd-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider. &nbsp;\nThe key changes are:&nbsp;\nThis dispensation will replace the Observational Practical Assessment (OPA) with an extended question and answer (Q&amp;A) session informed by specific video and photographic evidence to set requirements. All EPAOs must deliver the assessment according to the dispensation to support comparability for learners.&nbsp;\nThe video evidence must be comprised of 2 set tasks that target a range of KSBs that are mapped to the OPA. Each task will require video evidence (up to a maximum of 15 minutes each) and should be captured in the workplace or other suitable environment. The tasks may be simulated where required (e.g. to support seasonal availability) though examples of genuine real-world activities that align with the evidence requirements are preferred where possible. The photographic evidence will support the video evidence by capturing other areas of performance against the KSBs not covered by the 2 main tasks. The quantity of images will vary depending on the nature of the KSBs being captured. The EPAO must provide clear details of the requirements for each type of evidence (both video and photographic) that the apprentice must capture.&nbsp;\nBoth the video and photographic evidence should typically be obtained during the post-gateway period but can be obtained a maximum of 4 weeks prior to the apprentice’s gateway date (to avoid any crossover with the portfolio of evidence). All evidence must be submitted to the EPAO 10 days prior to the Q&amp;A session taking place to allow appropriate questions to be generated/ selected by the EPAO/ assessor. The video and photographic evidence will be reviewed by both the apprentice and assessor during the Q&amp;A session. The main focus of assessment is the responses (supported by reference to the required evidence) offered by the apprentice during the Q&amp;A session.

        "Banners": "A temporary dispensation has been applied to the ST0310 version 1.3 end-point assessment plan for this apprenticeship. The dispensation will last from 19/04/24 to 30/09/25, but may be withdrawn if the dispensation is no longer necessary.End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required. The key changes are: Apprentices cannot opt-out of undertaking the APM Project Management Qualification (PMQ) exam as it is still mandated within version 1.3 of this standard. However, apprentices who are ready for Gateway that have attempted, but not yet passed the PMQ exam are permitted to enter Gateway and proceed to EPA. These apprentices can sit their EPA and pass their apprenticeship without having attained the PMQ.Training Providers must provide written evidence at Gateway that apprentices have been booked in for their PMQ exam/resit before they move forward with the EPA. EPAOs cannot withhold the apprenticeship certificate for apprentices who have sat their EPA, undertaken their PMQ exam and not yet passed or not received their PMQ result.If your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this EPA, you should follow the requirements as they are detailed in the plan as the dispensation is only intended to support the cohort of apprentices described above. FAQs1. If a learner attempts the PMQ exam and does not achieve the PMQ, are they required to retake the examination until they achieve a passing grade? Answer: Whilst they may not be required to retake the examination, we would suggest that it would be good for them to do this as they have already completed the work on the PMQ.2. What is the recommended timeline for learners to undertake or attempt the PMQ following the EPA? Answer: That is up to the individual and their employer on when they are ready to do this.Please contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk should you require any further clarity."

The dispensation will last from 05/04/24 to 21/01/26 but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider. The key changes are: Apprentices made redundant at Gateway will be allowed complete a Strategic Business Proposal based on a theoretical topic. The Training Provider will step in as the employer for the duration of the EPA period in order to ensure apprentices can complete their apprenticeship.Skill Statements S2 and S3 will be assessed via the questioning component of the assessment. This dispensation applies to agreed cohorts only. EPAOs must contact IfATE for each individual case. If your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this EPA, you should follow the requirements as they are detailed in the plan as the dispensation is intended to support specific apprentices only.Please contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk should you require any further clarity."

These parts of the observation may be delivered remotely, in line with IfATE’s flexibility framework, but EPAOs must get agreement from their EQAP before implementing this mode of delivery.In addition to this temporary dispensation there is an additional element relating to the mandated Level 2 ICT qualification. For any apprentices registered from 1st August 2023 the gateway requirement for the achievement of the Level 2 ICT mandated qualification will be removed. This will remain in place until the revised version is approved as the revised standard will rework the ICT content into the standard’s KSBs as opposed to mandating a qualification."

All EPAOs must deliver the assessment according to the dispensation to support comparability for learners.&nbsp;\nThe video evidence must be comprised of 2 set tasks that target a range of KSBs that are mapped to the OPA. Each task will require video evidence (up to a maximum of 15 minutes each) and should be captured in the workplace or other suitable environment. The tasks may be simulated where required (e.g. to support seasonal availability) though examples of genuine real-world activities that align with the evidence requirements are preferred where possible. The photographic evidence will support the video evidence by capturing other areas of performance against the KSBs not covered by the 2 main tasks. The quantity of images will vary depending on the nature of the KSBs being captured. The EPAO must provide clear details of the requirements for each type of evidence (both video and photographic) that the apprentice must capture.&nbsp;\nBoth the video and photographic evidence should typically be obtained during the post-gateway period but can be obtained a maximum of 4 weeks prior to the apprentice’s gateway date (to avoid any crossover with the portfolio of evidence). All evidence must be submitted to the EPAO 10 days prior to the Q&amp;A session taking place to allow appropriate questions to be generated/ selected by the EPAO/ assessor. The video and photographic evidence will be reviewed by both the apprentice and assessor during the Q&amp;A session. The main focus of assessment is the responses (supported by reference to the required evidence) offered by the apprentice during the Q&amp;A session. The Q&amp;A session will be a maximum of 2 hours (inclusive of reviewing all evidence such as playing the video evidence). The Q&amp;A session may take place remotely.; A&nbsp;revised version of this occupational standard and end-point assessment plan has been agreed and is available for information only at present.

The key changes are: Reference to external documents now optional rather than mandatory.Weighting of assessment methods removed.Numerical marking removed.Double assessment removed.Mapping defined.Assessment methods clarified.Grading criteria outlined.Assessor requirements updated.Practical assessment updated to reflect current practices.Delivery of EPA updated allowing EPAs to be delivered independently of other organisations on the APAR.\n \nVersion 1.1/AP02 is superseded by version 1.1/AP03 and can be found here."

EPAOs must contact IfATE for each individual case. If your organisation is planning delivery of this EPA, you should follow the requirements as detailed in the plan as the dispensation is intended to support specific apprentices only.\nPlease contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk should you require any further clarity.; This apprenticeship is in the process of being revised or adjusted.

The dispensation will last from 29/05/24 to 24/05/25, but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.\nEnd-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider.\nThe key changes are:\nFor Assessment Method 1 (EPA 1 – Work-based project with professional discussion), organisations can use their own, suitably-qualified assessor to observe the training being delivered by the apprentice, or watch a recording of it, and complete a witness statement commenting on how the apprentice demonstrated competence of Skills S6, S7, S9 and S10.\nApprentices can submit the witness statement in the appendices of their work-based report instead of a video recording, along with any other supplementary evidence (e.g. resource planning, sessions plans, evaluation report of the training session), to support the assessment of S6, S7, S9 and S10.\nThis dispensation applies to agreed cohorts only. EPAOs must contact IfATE for each individual case. If your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this EPA, you should follow the requirements as they are detailed in the plan as the dispensation is intended to support specific apprentices only.\nPlease contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk should you require any further clarity."

Starts will be permitted only once a suitable EPAO is in place. We do not want any current apprentices to be disadvantaged so we have applied a temporary dispensation to the  V1.0 end-point assessment plan (EPA) version AP01 for this apprenticeship. The dispensation will last until 31st December 2025 and may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner, or the dispensation is no longer necessary.\nIf your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this standard and (or) EPA, you must contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk for further details before commencing with any development work as the current dispensation may impact upon feasibility."

The dispensation will last from 30/11/2023 to 30/11/2025 but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.Training Providers delivering the apprenticeship and End Point Assessment Organisations will implement the dispensation as required.The key changes are: The Chartered Institute of Securities and Investment (CISI) will be withdrawing the Advanced Certificate in Global Securities Operations pathway of their Diploma in Investment Operations qualification. This is a mandated qualification within this standard. The final exam will be on 30th November 2023 with no option to take the exams after this date. So that apprentices who have enrolled on the Advanced Certificate in Global Securities Operations pathway are not disadvantaged, the dispensation ensures that the requirement for apprentices to pass this qualification prior to gateway is waived. Apprentices can pass through gateway without the necessity to achieve this qualification if they were enrolled on this pathway prior to 30th November 2023. Apprentices are still permitted to take the Operational Risk pathway of the qualification as a replacement if they choose to (Level 3 Operational risk and Level 4 Managing Operational Risk in Financial Institutions). For further details please contact IfATE directly through the general enquiries inbox (enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk).; This apprenticeship will be retired from 25 March 2026"

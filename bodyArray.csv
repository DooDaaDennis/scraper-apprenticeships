OfS will be the regulator once the degree-apprenticeship becomes integrated.; There is currently no EPAO in place for this standard.
&nbsp;
We do not want any apprentice to be disadvantaged so we have applied a temporary dispensation to the ST0577 end-point assessment plan (EPA) version AP01 for this apprenticeship.
&nbsp;
The dispensation will last until 1st September 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The dispensation may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner, or the dispensation is no longer necessary.
&nbsp;
If your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this standard and (or) EPA, you must contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education before commencing with any development work for further details as the current dispensation may impact upon feasibility.; A revised version of this occupational standard and end-point assessment plan has been agreed and is available for information only at present. In the meantime, the version below remains approved for delivery. Further details of this and other apprenticeship standards in revision are available in the revisions status report.; This version of this standard meets the requirements of Registered Environmental Practitioner – REnvP. Upon receipt of the apprenticeship certificate, individuals are eligible to apply for REnvP through a shortened application route. Individuals also need to be a member of a professional body that is licensed by the Society for the Environment (SocEnv) to be awarded this status. Further information is on the SocEnv website."

Apprentices can submit the witness statement in the appendices of their work-based report instead of a video recording, along with any other supplementary evidence (e.g. resource planning, sessions plans, evaluation report of the training session), to support the assessment of S6, S7, S9 and S10.
This dispensation applies to agreed cohorts only. EPAOs must contact IfATE for each individual case. If your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this EPA, you should follow the requirements as they are detailed in the plan as the dispensation is intended to support specific apprentices only.
Please contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk should you require any further clarity."

The dispensation will last from 31/08/24 to 30/09/26 but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.&nbsp;
End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider. &nbsp;
The key changes are:&nbsp;
This dispensation will replace the Observational Practical Assessment (OPA) with an extended question and answer (Q&amp;A) session informed by specific video and photographic evidence to set requirements. All EPAOs must deliver the assessment according to the dispensation to support comparability for learners.&nbsp;
The video evidence must be comprised of 2 set tasks that target a range of KSBs that are mapped to the OPA. Each task will require video evidence (up to a maximum of 15 minutes each) and should be captured in the workplace or other suitable environment. The tasks may be simulated where required (e.g. to support seasonal availability) though examples of genuine real-world activities that align with the evidence requirements are preferred where possible. The photographic evidence will support the video evidence by capturing other areas of performance against the KSBs not covered by the 2 main tasks. The quantity of images will vary depending on the nature of the KSBs being captured. The EPAO must provide clear details of the requirements for each type of evidence (both video and photographic) that the apprentice must capture.&nbsp;
Both the video and photographic evidence should typically be obtained during the post-gateway period but can be obtained a maximum of 4 weeks prior to the apprentice’s gateway date (to avoid any crossover with the portfolio of evidence). All evidence must be submitted to the EPAO 10 days prior to the Q&amp;A session taking place to allow appropriate questions to be generated/ selected by the EPAO/ assessor. The video and photographic evidence will be reviewed by both the apprentice and assessor during the Q&amp;A session. The main focus of assessment is the responses (supported by reference to the required evidence) offered by the apprentice during the Q&amp;A session. The Q&amp;A session will be a maximum of 2 hours (inclusive of reviewing all evidence such as playing the video evidence). The Q&amp;A session may take place remotely.; A&nbsp;revised version of this occupational standard and end-point assessment plan has been agreed and is available for information only at present. In the meantime, the version below remains approved for delivery. Further details of this and other apprenticeship standards in revision are available in the revisions status report."

The dispensation will last from 10/11/2023 to 31/12/2025 but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.  End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider (EQAP).  The key changes are:  Assessment Method 2 – Planned Working Observation:  The Planned Working part of the observation may be replaced with a witness testimony of observed practice provided by the employer (or employer-provider) Questions and answer session with an external assessor will take place.As per the assessment plan, the Degraded Working and Emergency Working parts of the observation are simulated activities. These parts of the observation may be delivered remotely, in line with IfATE’s flexibility framework, but EPAOs must get agreement from their EQAP before implementing this mode of delivery.In addition to this temporary dispensation there is an additional element relating to the mandated Level 2 ICT qualification. For any apprentices registered from 1st August 2023 the gateway requirement for the achievement of the Level 2 ICT mandated qualification will be removed. This will remain in place until the revised version is approved as the revised standard will rework the ICT content into the standard’s KSBs as opposed to mandating a qualification."

The dispensation will last from 31/08/24 to 30/09/26 but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.&nbsp;
End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider. &nbsp;
The key changes are:&nbsp;
This dispensation will replace the Observational Practical Assessment (OPA) with an extended question and answer (Q&amp;A) session informed by specific video and photographic evidence to set requirements. All EPAOs must deliver the assessment according to the dispensation to support comparability for learners.&nbsp;
The video evidence must be comprised of 2 set tasks that target a range of KSBs that are mapped to the OPA. Each task will require video evidence (up to a maximum of 15 minutes each) and should be captured in the workplace or other suitable environment. The tasks may be simulated where required (e.g. to support seasonal availability) though examples of genuine real-world activities that align with the evidence requirements are preferred where possible. The photographic evidence will support the video evidence by capturing other areas of performance against the KSBs not covered by the 2 main tasks. The quantity of images will vary depending on the nature of the KSBs being captured. The EPAO must provide clear details of the requirements for each type of evidence (both video and photographic) that the apprentice must capture.&nbsp;
Both the video and photographic evidence should typically be obtained during the post-gateway period but can be obtained a maximum of 4 weeks prior to the apprentice’s gateway date (to avoid any crossover with the portfolio of evidence). All evidence must be submitted to the EPAO 10 days prior to the Q&amp;A session taking place to allow appropriate questions to be generated/ selected by the EPAO/ assessor. The video and photographic evidence will be reviewed by both the apprentice and assessor during the Q&amp;A session. The main focus of assessment is the responses (supported by reference to the required evidence) offered by the apprentice during the Q&amp;A session. The Q&amp;A session will be a maximum of 2 hours (inclusive of reviewing all evidence such as playing the video evidence). The Q&amp;A session may take place remotely.; A&nbsp;revised version of this occupational standard and end-point assessment plan has been agreed and is available for information only at present. In the meantime, the version below remains approved for delivery. Further details of this and other apprenticeship standards in revision are available in the revisions status report."

End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider.&nbsp;
The key changes are:&nbsp;
1.2 Assessment arrangements when national security is a factor&nbsp;
The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) may approve a variation to EPA delivery where it confirms, having considered adequate evidence, it is satisfied that:&nbsp;&nbsp;
• all options supporting a fully independent model have been exhausted and&nbsp;&nbsp;
• national security issues prevent remote end-point assessment and&nbsp;
• the fair assessment of occupational competence can only be achieved in the apprentice’s operating environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is expected this approach to delivery is only applicable to the Royal Navy because of their unique operating environment combined with their role in connection with national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;
IfATE must be satisfied that every possible way of having a fully independent EPA has been considered and that the unique circumstances of the Royal Navy prevents any arrangements for a fully independent model.&nbsp;
IfATE must also be satisfied that the EPA meets all of its other requirements, including the delivery of valid and accurate judgements of occupational competence, such that all apprentices who complete the EPA will be judged competent in the occupation regardless of who their employer is.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Bespoke EPA arrangements for this apprenticeship have been approved by IfATE for the Royal Navy to use. Further details can be found on the apprenticeships web-page on the IfATE website.

The final apprenticeship EPA decision will be made by the EPAO; successful achievement of the EPA will lead to formal certification of the apprenticeship and demonstrate that the apprentice is a competent Unified Communications Trouble Shooter."

The dispensation will last from 19/04/24 to 30/09/25, but may be withdrawn if the dispensation is no longer necessary.End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required. The key changes are: Apprentices cannot opt-out of undertaking the APM Project Management Qualification (PMQ) exam as it is still mandated within version 1.3 of this standard. However, apprentices who are ready for Gateway that have attempted, but not yet passed the PMQ exam are permitted to enter Gateway and proceed to EPA. These apprentices can sit their EPA and pass their apprenticeship without having attained the PMQ.Training Providers must provide written evidence at Gateway that apprentices have been booked in for their PMQ exam/resit before they move forward with the EPA. EPAOs cannot withhold the apprenticeship certificate for apprentices who have sat their EPA, undertaken their PMQ exam and not yet passed or not received their PMQ result.If your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this EPA, you should follow the requirements as they are detailed in the plan as the dispensation is only intended to support the cohort of apprentices described above. FAQs1. If a learner attempts the PMQ exam and does not achieve the PMQ, are they required to retake the examination until they achieve a passing grade? Answer: Whilst they may not be required to retake the examination, we would suggest that it would be good for them to do this as they have already completed the work on the PMQ.2. What is the recommended timeline for learners to undertake or attempt the PMQ following the EPA? Answer: That is up to the individual and their employer on when they are ready to do this.Please contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk should you require any further clarity."
